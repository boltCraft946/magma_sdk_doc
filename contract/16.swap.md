# Swap

Swaps typically occur in two steps:

+ the first step involves pre-calculating the potential result of the current transactionï¼›

+ the second step is to set the slippage based on the pre-calculated results, followed by executing the transaction.

After pre-calcualting then you can do swap via:

+ swap

## Swap after preswap

After pre-calcualting then swap. For a more detailed understanding of the pre-swap process and its intricacies, additional information is available here.

### Function input param
Please refer to the original function for specific parameter types.

+ poolID: pool object id, you can get it by pre-calcualting.

+ coinTypeA: the coin type address about coinA.

+ coinTypeB: the coin type address about coinB.

+ a2b: swap direction, true means swap from coinA to coinB, false means swap from coinB to CoinA.

+ byAmountIn: true means fixed the amount of input, false means fixed the amount of output.

+ amount: the amount of input (byAmountIn = true) or output (byAmountIn = false).

+ amountLimit: the amount limit of coin what you get. There are two scenarios in amount limit, when by_amount_in equals true, amount limit means minimum number of outputs required to be obtained, when by_amount_in equals false, it means maximum number of input coin.

+ partner: The partner address. If you do not have a partner, simply leave the partner field unset.

  Notice:

    + This is the amount out of result after slippage adjustment. Use adjustForSlippage to calculate the limit of amount out.

    + If you set amount limit equal 0, when you trade during extremely volatile price fluctuations, you might end up with a very small trading outcome. The amountLimit will help prevent your assets from incurring losses.

    + You can get more details in these Partner swap parts.


### Example

```typescript
const sendKeypair = buildTestAccount()
// Whether the swap direction is token a to token b
const a2b = true
// fix input token amount
const coinAmount = new BN(120000)
// input token amount is token a
const byAmountIn = true
// slippage value
const slippage = Percentage.fromDecimal(d(5))
// Fetch pool data
const pool = await sdk.Pool.getPool(poolAddress)
// Estimated amountIn amountOut fee
const res: any = await sdk.Swap.preswap({
  pool: pool,
  current_sqrt_price: pool.current_sqrt_price,
  coinTypeA: pool.coinTypeA,
  coinTypeB: pool.coinTypeB,
  decimalsA: 6, // coin a 's decimals
  decimalsB: 8, // coin b 's decimals
  a2b,
  by_amount_in,
  amount,
})

const partner = '0x8e0b7668a79592f70fbfb1ae0aebaf9e2019a7049783b9a4b6fe7c6ae038b528'

const toAmount = byAmountIn ? res.estimatedAmountOut : res.estimatedAmountIn
const amountLimit =  adjustForSlippage(toAmount, slippage, !byAmountIn)

// build swap Payload
const swapPayload = sdk.Swap.createSwapTransactionPayload(
  {
    pool_id: pool.poolAddress,
    coinTypeA: pool.coinTypeA,
    coinTypeB: pool.coinTypeB
    a2b: a2b,
    by_amount_in: by_amount_in,
    amount: res.amount.toString(),
    amount_limit: amountLimit.toString(),
    swap_partner: partner,
  },
)

const transferTxn = await sendTransaction(signer,swapPayload)
console.log('swap: ', transferTxn)
```

## Swap without transfer coins

This methods support return two coins for user to build PTB.
Function input param

Please refer to the original function for specific parameter types.

+ poolID: pool object id, you can get it by pre-calcualting.

+ coinTypeB: the coin type address about coinB.

+ a2b: swap direction, true means swap from coinA to coinB, false means swap from coinB to CoinA.

+ byAmountIn: true means fixed the amount of input, false means fixed the amount of output.

+ amount: the amount of input (byAmountIn = true) or output (byAmountIn = false).

+ amountLimit: the amount limit of coin what you get. There are two scenarios in amount limit, when by_amount_in equals true, amount limit means minimum number of outputs required to be obtained, when by_amount_in equals false, it means maximum number of input coin.

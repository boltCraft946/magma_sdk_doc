# Price impact

How to calculate price impact?

Price impact means the variation rate between the prices of the two coins in actual transactions and the pre-calculated prices.

The SDK providers the sdk.Swap.calculateSwapPriceImpact method to calculated it.


```typescript
const res = await sdk.RouterV2.getBestRouter(USDT, USDC, 100000000, true, 5, '', undefined, true, false)

const priceImpact =  sdk.Swap.calculateSwapPriceImpact(res.result.splitPaths)
console.log('priceImpact: ', priceImpact )
```

# Minimum received & Maximum sold

## How to calculate minimun received?

When fixed input amount, minimum received means the min amount of the received coin, it equals outputAmount * (1 - slippageTolerance).If swap during times of significant price fluctuations, and swap result of output amount less than minimum received, this transaction will be rejected.

### Example

```typescript
const res = await sdk.RouterV2.getBestRouter(USDT, USDC, 100000000, true, 5, '', undefined, true, false)
const slippageTolerance = 0.01

const minReceived =  res.result.outputAmount * (1 - slippageTolerance)
console.log('minReceived: ', minReceived )
```

## How to calculate maximum sold?

When fixed output amount, maximum sold means the max amount of the sold coin, it equals inputAmount * (1 + slippageTolerance).If swap during times of significant price fluctuations, and  swap result of input amount more than maximum sold, this transaction will be rejected.

### Example

```
const res = await sdk.RouterV2.getBestRouter(USDT, USDC, 100000000, true, 5, '', undefined, true, false)
const slippageTolerance = 0.01

const maxSold =  res.result.inputAmount * (1 + slippageTolerance)
console.log('maxSold: ', maxSold )
```

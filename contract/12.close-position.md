# Close position

When you withdraw all the liquidity from your position, you can decide whether to close the position. Please note that when closing the position, you must also withdraw all the current position's liquidity, fees, and rewards.

Params:

Please refer to the original function for specific parameter types.

- `poolID`: The object id about which pool you want to operation.

- `posID`: The object id about position.

- `minAmountA`: The minimum amount of coin A that a user can acquire.

- `maxAmountB`: The minimum amount of coin B that a user can acquire.

  > Because of pool price will change, the amount of coin A and coin B will change. So the `min_amount_a` and `min_amount_a` means no matter how the price moves, the amount quantity that I need to receive at least is typically obtained by adding the amount potentially acquired through calculations to the slippage adjustment.

- `rewarderCoinTypes`: If these not empty, it will collect rewarders in this position, if you already open the position. You can even determine which types of rewards you want to harvest by specifying the coin types you pass.

Example

```typescript
const sendKeypair = buildTestAccount()
// Fetch pool data
const pool = await sdk.Pool.getPool(poolAddress)
// Fetch position data
const position = await sdk.Position.getPositionInfo(position_object_id)
// build tick data
const lowerSqrtPrice = TickMath.tickIndexToSqrtPriceX64(position.tick_lower_index)
const upperSqrtPrice = TickMath.tickIndexToSqrtPriceX64(position.tick_upper_index)
const ticksHandle = pool.ticks_handle
const tickLower = await sdk.Pool.getTickDataByIndex(ticksHandle, position.tick_lower_index)
const tickUpper = await sdk.Pool.getTickDataByIndex(ticksHandle, position.tick_upper_index)
// input liquidity amount for remove
const liquidity = new BN(position.liquidity)
// slippage value
const slippageTolerance = new Percentage(new BN(5), new BN(100))
const curSqrtPrice = new BN(pool.current_sqrt_price)
// Get token amount from liquidity.
const coinAmounts = ClmmPoolUtil.getCoinAmountFromLiquidity(liquidity, curSqrtPrice, lowerSqrtPrice, upperSqrtPrice, false)
// adjust  token a and token b amount for slippage
const { tokenMaxA, tokenMaxB } = adjustForCoinSlippage(coinAmounts, slippageTolerance, false)
// get all rewarders of position
const rewards: any[] = await sdk.Rewarder.posRewardersAmount(poolObjectId,pool.positions_handle, position_object_id)
const rewardCoinTypes = rewards.filter((item) => Number(item.amount_owed) > 0).map((item)=> item.coin_address)
// build close position payload
const closePositionTransactionPayload = sdk.Position.closePositionTransactionPayload({
      coinTypeA: pool.coinTypeA,
      coinTypeB: pool.coinTypeB,
      min_amount_a: tokenMaxA.toString(),
      min_amount_b: tokenMaxB.toString(),
      rewarder_coin_types: [...rewardCoinTypes],
      pool_id: pool.poolAddress,
      pos_id: position_object_id,
    })

const transferTxn = await sdk.fullClient.sendTransaction(sendKeypair,closePositionTransactionPayload)
console.log('close position: ', transferTxn)
```

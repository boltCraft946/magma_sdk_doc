# Collect fees

When you add liquidity within a valid price range, all transaction fees generated within this range will be distributed based on the proportional share of effective liquidity from all positions within the current range. If you intend to harvest transaction fees separately, please follow the method below.

Params:

Please refer to the original function for specific parameter types.

- `poolID`: The object id about which pool you want to operation.

- `posID`: The object id about position.

- `coinTypeA`: the coin type address about coinA.

- `coinTypeB`: the coin type address about coinB.

### Example

```typescript
const sendKeypair = buildTestAccount()
// Fetch pool data
const pool = await sdk.Pool.getPool(poolAddress)
// Fetch position data
const position =  await sdk.Position.getPosition(position_object_id)

// build collect fee Payload
const removeLiquidityPayload = (await sdk.Position.collectFeeTransactionPayload(
        {
          pool_id: pool.poolAddress,
          coinTypeA: pool.coinTypeA,
          coinTypeB: pool.coinTypeB,
          pos_id: position.position_object_id,
        },
        true
      ))
const transferTxn = await sdk.fullClient.sendTransaction(sendKeypair,collectFeeTransactionPayload)
console.log('collect_fee: ', transferTxn)
```
